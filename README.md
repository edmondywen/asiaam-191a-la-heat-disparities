## Objective
- At a macro level, the urban heat island effect in Los Angeles. At a micro level, this project attempts to understand how residents in Little Tokyo deal with heat in their neighborhood. 
- We aim to empower the residents of Little Tokyo to share their lived experiences related to heat in their neighborhood. 

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
- Technical
    - How to elicit heat stories from Little Tokyo residents. It might be difficult to recollect a story or a memory of dealing with heat through just the survey
    - Collecting stories from a diverse group of Little Tokyo residents. We want to cast a wide net and gather stories form all demographics living in Little Tokyo and not exclude any particular group from participation. 

- Ethical 
    - Privacy: Our study could potentially involve personally identifying information like income, address, and ethnicity
    - Must not minimize people's concerns. There will be some qualitative/subjective input from users regarding their personal situations. We need to properly represent those perspectives

## How others could use this in the future
The user stories gathered from this mapplication can be a critical data point for several community-based projects, including decision-making made by politicians, urban planners, local business development, and so on. Our documentation on GitHub, an open source platform, allows community members to view our prototype and get involved or make a derivative project utilizing the program elements we've documented (e.g. code, survey questions).
